# Risk Simulation Methods
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview:

In this project, three risk simulation methods are implemented in the Python programming language. These are the historical simulation, the variance-covariance method and the Monte Carlo simulation.
The aim is to introduce master students step by step to the use of programming languages such as Python and to convey the theoretical concepts from the lecture using a practical example.
